### Overview

W3bstream **** is a general framework for connecting data generated by devices and machines in the physical world to the blockchain world. In a nutshell, W3bStream uses the [IoTeX blockchain](https://docs.iotex.io) to orchestrate a decentralized network of gateways (i.e., _W3bStream nodes_) that streams \[encrypted] data from IoT devices and machines and generates _proofs of real-world facts_ to different blockchains.&#x20;

Blockchain developers can build their dApps getting access to trusted real-world data using the W3bStream framework.

### W3bstream Node architecture

To support a wide range of applications and business requirements, a W3bStream node includes the following connectivity, computing, storage, and consensus components, for interacting with the IoT devices, blockchain, and node operators:

#### **Service Endpoint**

The service endpoint implements a number of communication protocols (e.g., MQTT, HTTP, RPC, etc.) to communicate with smart devices, blockchain, and node operators.

#### **Virtual File System**

The virtual file system is used to store a business program (i.e., WebAssembly modules that implement the business logic of a specific MachineFi application) as well as intermediate computation results**.**

#### **Execution Engine**

The W3bstream execution engine runs the pre-defined business logic that process incoming data from smart devices, blockchain events, and more. The execution engine is based on a WebAssembly VM and the WASI interface, and it can run multiple WASM modules in parallel.

#### Consensus

The consensus module implements a number of consensus algorithms (e.g., Proof of Authority -PoA, Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance – PBFT, etc…) for realizing a decentralized W3bStream network.

#### **Database**

The database component represents an abstract storage interface and its goal is to serve as the long term storage of the raw/encrypted data received from smart devices. Different storage implementations can be plugged in: from a simple local relational database, to a decentralized storage solution like IPFS. Data retention policies can also be configured for this module, depending on the application needs.

#### SSI Wallet

The SSI wallet implements decentralized identifiers and verifiable credentials-related functionalities for managing the identity of a W3bstream node.

### Lifecycle

The W3bstream Network incentivizes communities to run nodes for supporting the growing ecosystem of MachineFi dApps. Depending on the requirements of a specific dApp, a certain number of W3bstream nodes might be employed to serve it: such subnet of W3bstream node will start operating when the sufficient number of community nodes will have joined.

Any community member who is interested in operating a W3bstream node could provision a virtual machine on the cloud or set up a local server.
