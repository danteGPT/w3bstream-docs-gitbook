# Applet SDKs

To make it easier for developers to create and deploy W3bstream applets, IoTeX maintains three software development kits (SDKs) that provide wrappers for W3bstream's [host functions](../../reference/abi-functions-reference.md).&#x20;

These SDKs allow developers to write W3bstream applets using popular programming languages, such as AssemblyScript, Rust, and Go, and provide pre-built functions and libraries for interacting with the W3bstream network.

By leveraging the W3bstream SDKs, developers can accelerate the development of decentralized physical infrastructure networks (_DePIN_) that leverage the blockchain technology. The SDKs abstract away many of the complexities of building applets for W3bstream, allowing developers to focus on creating innovative and useful applications.
