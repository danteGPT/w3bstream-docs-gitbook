# Applet SDKs

W3bstream provides SDKs for several programming languages, allowing developers to create W3bstream applets in the language of their choice. Currently, W3bstream supports the following programming languages:

* AssemblyScript
* Rust
* Go

Each SDK provides a set of tools and libraries that enable developers to interact with the W3bstream network and create W3bstream applets. The SDKs include wrappers for W3bstream's host functions, allowing developers to write applet logic in their chosen language and deploy it to the W3bstream network.

#### AssemblyScript SDK

The AssemblyScript SDK is a set of tools and libraries that enable developers to create W3bstream applets using the AssemblyScript programming language. For more information on using the AssemblyScript SDK, please see the [AssemblyScript documentation](assemblyscript.md).

#### Rust SDK

The Rust SDK is a set of tools and libraries that enable developers to create W3bstream applets using the Rust programming language. For more information on using the Rust SDK, please see the [Rust SDK documentation](rust.md).

#### Go SDK

The Go SDK is a set of tools and libraries that enable developers to create W3bstream applets using the Go programming language. For more information on using the Go SDK, please see the [Go SDK documentation](go.md).
