# Basic concepts

### Applets

W3bstream's execution engine is based on a WebAssembly virtual machine, therefore W3bstream applets must be compiled as WebAssembly Modules (WASM). WASM is a binary instruction format designed for the WebAssembly abstract, stack-based machine.

WASM binaries can be generated from multiple high-level languages, including:

* WebAssembly Text Format ([natively supported](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/Understanding\_the\_text\_format))
* AssemblyScript [(natively supported)](https://www.assemblyscript.org/introduction.html)
* Rust ([natively supported)](https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/book/introduction.html)
* C/C++ (supported through [emscripten](https://emscripten.org/index.html))
* Golang (supported through [tiny go](https://tinygo.org/docs/))

Other resources to learn WebAssembly are:

* [WebAssembly Full Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly)
* [WebAssembly Developer Guide](https://webassembly.org/getting-started/developers-guide/)
* [WebAssembly Tutorial](https://marcoselvatici.github.io/WASM\_tutorial/)
