# Projects

W3bstream Projects represent containers for the node logic. This logic is implemented in the form of functions (called _event handlers_) exported inside WASM modules (called _applets_) that are deployed to W3bstream projects.

Multiple applets can be deployed to a project, and multiple handlers can be exported in the same applet. For each W3bstream project, one or more [event strategies](projects.md#event-strategies) can be configured, as well as several [publishers](projects.md#publishers) can be authorized to send data messages to the project.&#x20;
