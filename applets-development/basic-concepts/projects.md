# Projects

W3bstream Projects serve as containers for your DePIN logic. A W3bstream Project includes the following:

* Event Triggers
* Event Routing Strategies
* Device Accounts
* rs. The project's logic is implemented through functions, known as _Handlers_, which are exported inside a WebAssembly (WASM) module, also known as an _Applet_. A Project is created by deploying its applet to W3bstream.

Although only a single applet can be attached to a project upon creation, multiple handlers can be defined within an applet.

W3bstream Projects provide a flexible and scalable solution for handling events and data in a decentralized environment. With the ability to customize event routing and data publishing strategies, W3bstream Projects can be tailored to fit a wide range of use cases.
