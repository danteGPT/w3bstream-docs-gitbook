# Configuring Devices

Before your project can receive any data messages from a device, you will need to add a new device account in the Devices tab of the Project Editor. Simply assign a unique Key to this device, and a random authorization token will be assigned to it.

Any client device intending to send data to your W3bstream project must include a valid authentication token within the message. Depending on your use case, you can use one token for each device or for groups of devices.
