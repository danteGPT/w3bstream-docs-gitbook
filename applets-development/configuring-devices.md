# Configuring Devices

Before your project can receive any data messages from a device, you will need to add a new device account in the _Devices_ tab of the Project Editor. See the quick video below to learn how to create a new Device Account:

{% content-ref url="configuring-devices.md" %}
[configuring-devices.md](configuring-devices.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

Any client device intending to send data to your W3bstream project must include a valid authentication token within the message.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Depending on your use case, you can use one token for each device or for groups of devices.
{% endhint %}
