# Configuring Devices

Before your project can receive any data messages from a device, you will need to add a new device account in the _Devices_ tab of the Project Editor.&#x20;

## Creating Devices using W3bstream Studio

See the quick video below to learn how to create a new Device Account:

{% content-ref url="configuring-devices.md" %}
[configuring-devices.md](configuring-devices.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

Any client device intending to send data to your W3bstream project must include a valid authentication token within the message.&#x20;
