# Introduction

Before explaining how to develop an applet, it is important to introduce what a W3bstream project is. A W3bstream project is a combination of software functions, event logic, data storage, triggers, environment variables, and all the settings that collectively determine how a DePIN application receives and processes data from devices, generates "data-based proofs" that a Dapp may require, and how it reacts/interacts with the blockchain.

A W3bstream project is created concurrently with the deployment of an applet on a W3bstream node, such as through the W3bstream Studio interface. If you don't have a ready-to-use applet, you can start by creating a project based on the "_Hello World_" applet, directly accessible from inside W3bstream Studio. Later on, you can replace it with a new applet.

Once a project is created, you will find it in the home page of W3bstream Studio: click on the project to open the Project editor area where you will be able to configure the different apsects of your project.
