# TypeScript/JavaScript

While TypeScript and JavaScript compilers do not directly target WebAssembly (WASM), **AssemblyScript** offers an excelent alternative.&#x20;

Serving as a TypeScript-like language designed exclusively for WebAssembly, AssemblyScript provides an great pathway for TypeScript and JavaScript developers to leverage the capabilities of WebAssembly.

For more comprehensive details, please refer to the AssemblyScript Applet Kit documentation:
