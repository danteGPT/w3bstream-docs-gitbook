# Introduction to Client SDKs

W3bstream aims to accommodate a wide range of IoT devices with different hardware components and capabilities, from legacy Web2-based products, over community-driven development boards, to emerging Web3-oriented devices and mobile phones.

W3bstream Client SDKs implement the messaging protocol required to send data to a project deployed to the W3bstream, as well as the API to interact with the network.

By using the W3bstream Client SDK, you can ensure that your data is sent securely and reliably to your W3bstream project. The SDK takes care of authentication, encryption, and other important details, so you can focus on building your project.
