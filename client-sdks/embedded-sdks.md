# Embedded SDK

The W3bstream IoT SDK (_WSIoTSDK_ for short) is an open-source project developed and maintained by IoTeX.&#x20;

The primary goal of _WSIoTSDK_ is to connect a wide range of IoT devices (e.g., smart sensors, smart watches, car dongles, etc.) and community-driven development boards (e.g., Raspberry Pi, Arduino, ESP32, etc.) to a network of decentralized W3bStream nodes, for unlocking the emerging trillion-dollar machine economy.&#x20;

_WSIoTSDK_ is an essential component of IoTeX's W3bStream framework.
