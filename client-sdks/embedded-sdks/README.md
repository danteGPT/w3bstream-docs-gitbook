# Embedded SDK

The W3bstream IoT SDK (_WSIoTSDK_ for short) is an open source project developed and maintained by IoTeX. The primary goal of _WSIoTSDK_ is to connect a wide range of IoT devices (e.g., smart sensors, smart watches, car dongles, etc.) and community-driven development boards (e.g., Raspberry Pi, Arduino, ESP32, etc.) to a network of decentralized W3bStream nodes for unlocking emerging trillion-dollar machine economy.&#x20;

_WSIoTSDK_ is an essential component of the IoTeX's W3bStream framework.
