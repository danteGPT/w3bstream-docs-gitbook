# Access W3bstream

Although W3bstream is still under development, you can already start building and testing DePIN projects using the W3bstream DevNet release.&#x20;

## Access the public DevNet

The easiest way to access the W3bstream DevNet is to open a Metamask-enabled browser and navigate to the public W3bstream service officially deployed and maintained by the IoTeX team, accessible at:

{% hint style="success" %}
[**https://dev.w3bstream.com**](https://dev.w3bstream.com)
{% endhint %}

To access your projects page, please log in with your Metamask account. It is important to note that using the same account each time will ensure continued access to your projects. For added security, you may want to consider creating a dedicated Metamask account specifically for W3bstream.
