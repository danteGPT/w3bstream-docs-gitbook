# Running an Applet

Once deployed, your applet will have to be started for W3bstream to be able to run the logic it provides. Running and stopping applets is very easy by using W3bstream Studio. Once you're logged in, just click the project you are interested in, then locate and click the applet that you want to start, and use the respective `Run`, `Stop`, and `Restart` buttons in the Instance section to command the execution of the applet:

The Instance section will also provide you information on the current status of an applet.
