# Adding Devices

By going to the _Devices_ tab in WS Studio, you'll be able to add a new device to your project. All you need to specify when adding a new device is its unique _**Publisher Key**_. W3bstream will then create a unique _**Token**_ that you'll have to include, together with the Publisher Key, in the header of the message your device will be sending to your WS project.&#x20;
