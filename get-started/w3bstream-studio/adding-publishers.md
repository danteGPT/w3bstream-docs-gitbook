To add a Publisher account make sure you have [created a Project](creating-projects.md) first, then click the **`Publishers`** section, and click the <mark style="color:blue;">**`Add Publisher`**</mark> button:

Select the Project you want to add the Publisher account to, give it a name to help you recognize it, and finally assign a unique ID to the account:

Once the Publisher account is created, it will be listed in the Publishers section of W3bstream Studio, along with the authorization token associated to it, ready to be used in the device [message header](../../applets-development/basic-concepts/events.md):
