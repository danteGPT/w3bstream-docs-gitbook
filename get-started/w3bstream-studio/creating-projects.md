# Creating Projects

Creating a project is a straightforward process: simply choose a name (using only lowercase letters and no special characters), select a tag that best represents the project's vertical, and decide whether to use a code template or upload your code from your machine.

Once a project is created, it automatically starts running, with the option to easily pause and resume as needed. When a project is paused, W3bstream will cease responding to events, allowing developers more control over their project's workflow.
