# Routing Events

Event routing serves as a fundamental aspect of W3bstream, encompassing the rules that determine which handlers are invoked in your project based on the triggered W3bstream events.

Upon creating a new project, a _**DEFAULT**_ event is automatically generated. This event corresponds to any W3bstream event raised by your app and subsequently calls the _**start**_ handler, assuming your applet includes a _**start**_ function.

If you prefer not to use a _**DEFAULT**_ event routing, you can easily delete it and create custom event routings tailored to the specific event strategies required for your project.
