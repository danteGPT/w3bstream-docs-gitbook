# Sending Test Data

The third method for triggering a W3bstream event involves utilizing an actual IoT device. However, if you don't have access to such a device, you can still simulate the process using the _**Log**_ tab.

To do so, simply click on the "_play_" button within the _**Log**_ tab. This action allows you to simulate sending a message to your W3bstream project. In the header, specify the _**event\_type**_, which corresponds to the W3bstream event you wish to trigger when the message is sent. You can either use the default _**payload**_ object provided or modify it as needed.

Since this is a simulation, there is no need to specify the _**pub\_id**_ and _**token**_.
