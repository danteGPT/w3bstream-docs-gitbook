# W3bstream Data API

## Introduction

W3bstream provides HTTP and MQTT network endpoints that facilitate the transmission of data messages to active projects. If the SDK you are using doesn't wrap the W3bstream API or if you are developing your own W3bstream client, this section offers a detailed explanation of the W3bstream data API.

## **Data Publishers**

In W3bstream, a "Data Publisher" (or simply a "_Publisher"_) is any authorized client capable of sending data messages to a W3bstream project. Publishers can take various forms, including connected devices equipped with either an HTTP client or an MQTT client. These can range from smart devices and servers to mobile phones and more.
