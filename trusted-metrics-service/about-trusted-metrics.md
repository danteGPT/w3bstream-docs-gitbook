### Effortless Monitoring

Thanks to the Trusted Metrics solution provided by W3bstream, monitoring projects becomes effortless, and the gathered metrics serve as the foundation for building insightful dashboards.

These dashboards offer valuable information and insights into the performance of DePIN applications, enabling builders to make informed decisions and drive their projects toward success.&#x20;

### Flexible Dashboard Options

Developers have the flexibility to utilize the official [W3bstream dashboard ](https://metrics.w3bstream.com)by just submitting their project's metadata to the IoTeX Foundation, as well as leveraging public dashboard services that integrate with W3bstream, such as [DePINDD](https://depindd.com/). Finally, they can conveniently access their project's metrics by querying the Trusted Metrics API, to seamlessly create their own dashboards, integrate with other systems, or enable further analysis of the collected data.&#x20;

### Benefits of the Trusted Metrics Service

The Trusted Metrics service offered by W3bstream provides several benefits for developers:

The service allows for the computation of metrics privately, protecting confidential information while still providing valuable insights to the network participants.
