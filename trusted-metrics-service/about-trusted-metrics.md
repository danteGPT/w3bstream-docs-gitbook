# About Trusted Metrics

W3bstream's Trusted Metrics is a powerful service that enables developers to seamlessly establish project metrics by harnessing the data collected from their devices. Thanks to the Trusted Metrics solution, monitoring projects becomes effortless, and the gathered metrics serve as the foundation for building insightful dashboards. These dashboards offer valuable information and insights into the performance of DePIN applications, enabling developers to make informed decisions and drive their projects towards success.&#x20;

Additionally, developers have the flexibility to utilize pre-built dashboards provided by IoTeX, leverage public dashboard services like [DePINDD](https://depindd.com/), or create their custom dashboards, tailored to their specific needs.&#x20;

Developers can conveniently access project metrics through an API, allowing seamless integration with other systems and enabling further analysis and visualization of the collected data

### Aggregated Metrics

W3bstream's Aggregated Metrics are a comprehensive set of performance metrics collected from every W3bstream project. These metrics are transmitted by W3bstream to IoTeX's dedicated "Metrics Center", which serves as a trusted repository for the data. Through the Metrics Center's API, developers can easily access and retrieve the aggregated metrics for their projects.&#x20;

The Aggregated Metrics currently consist of the following components:

* `"publisher_metrics":` provide valuable insights into the number of devices that have been authorized within the project,
* `"inbound_event_metrics":`reveal the quantity of project events generated by the messages sent by devices.&#x20;

### Custom Metrics

Custom Metrics provide developers with the flexibility to generate and transmit project-specific metrics from within their applets. These custom metrics can be derived from the data collected from devices, allowing developers to gain deeper insights into the performance and behavior of their projects.

### Benefits of the Trusted Metrics Service

The Trusted Metrics service offered by W3bstream provides several benefits for developers:

1. **Privacy-Preserving Sharing**: With Trusted Metrics, developers can share selected public metrics while ensuring the privacy and security of sensitive data. The service allows for the computation of metrics privately, protecting confidential information while still providing valuable insights to the network participants.
2. **PromQL Compatibility**: Trusted Metrics supports the `PromQL` query language, making it easy for developers to retrieve and analyze metrics data. `PromQL` is a powerful and intuitive query language designed specifically for working with time-series data, making it a seamless integration for leveraging metrics in W3bstream projects.
3. **Serverless Architecture**: The Trusted Metrics service operates on a serverless architecture, eliminating the need for developers to manage infrastructure or worry about scalability. This means that developers can focus on building their projects and leveraging metrics without the burden of server management.&#x20;
