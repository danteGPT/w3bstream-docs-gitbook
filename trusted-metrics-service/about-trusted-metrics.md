# About Trusted Metrics

W3bstream's Trusted Metrics is a robust and versatile feature designed to gather project performance and data metrics effortlessly. These metrics are made accessible through an API, allowing them to be displayed not only in the official W3bstream Explorer but also in third-party platforms.&#x20;

With Trusted Metrics, developers can harness the data collected from their devices to build custom dashboards seamlessly, enabling them to gain valuable insights into their projects' performance.

### Flexible Dashboard Options

Developers have the flexibility to utilize the official [W3bstream Explorer ](https://metrics.w3bstream.com)by just submitting their project's metadata to the IoTeX Foundation, as well as leveraging public dashboard services that integrate with W3bstream, such as [DePINDD](https://depindd.com/). Finally, they can conveniently access their project's metrics by querying the Trusted Metrics API, to seamlessly create their own dashboards, integrate with other systems, or enable further analysis of the collected data.&#x20;
