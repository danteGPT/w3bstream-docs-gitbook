# Building Dashboards

W3bstream developers can effortlessly create their own project dashboards directly inside the Trusted Metrics Query Designer.

Once a query is created in the Designer, you have the option to add one or multiple "Visualizations," for your query. Visualizations essentially are UI widgets that represent the query results with the most suitable charts based on the nature, fields, and number of the query results.

By utilizing these visualizations, developers can easily create public dashboards for everyone to visualize and interpret their project, making it more accessible and meaningful.

## Creating a Visualization Widget for a query

Let's assume you have created a query that returns the growth of device registrations in your W3bstream project (an example of such query can be seen in the [query-examples.md](query-examples.md "mention") document) and that you saved this query under the name "Devices Growth".

1. Use the <mark style="color:blue;">**`New Visualization`**</mark> button to create a Visualization for the query:

2. Select <mark style="color:blue;">**`Line Chart`**</mark> and then <mark style="color:blue;">**`Submit`**</mark>

3. Select the Line Chart tab to see a preview of the Visualization. Depending on your needs, you can provide different visualizations for the same query.&#x20;

4. If required, create more queries and Visualizations in the Query Designer.&#x20;
5. Head over to your profile menu in the top-right corner of the window and select the profile icon to access your Dashboards (or, if you haven't created a dashboard yet, click the <mark style="color:blue;">**`+`**</mark> button to create one):

6. Once you opened your Dashboard, you can easily add a set of Visualizations among those you have previously created, and configure them in the best layout that fits your needs.  Once done, click the Save Layout button to save your dashboard:

7. Once your Dashboard is saved, it becomes publicly available, and you can make it available by simply sharing its link
