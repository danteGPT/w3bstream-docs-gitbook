The **Queries List panel (1)**, located on the left side, displays a list of all queries that have already been created. You can select a query from this panel at any time to edit it.

The **Query Editor (2)** is where you type your actual query, and in the bottom-right corner, you will find the _Run Button_ to test your query.

The **Query Results (3)** panel, located at the bottom, displays the results generated by your query after you run it.

Finally, the **Save button (4)**, located in the top-right corner, lets you save your query once you are happy with the results.
